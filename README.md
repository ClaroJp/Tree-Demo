## Why I Made This Program
I made this application to improve my understanding of data structures, especially binary search trees, and how they can be used to organize and manage information. By creating this contact manager, I learned how to implement key operations like adding, searching, and deleting elements in a structured way. This application helps me by reinforcing my coding skills and understanding of tree structures. It contributes to the community by offering a simple, easy-to-understand tool for managing contacts. It also serves as a beginner-friendly example for others who are learning about data structures and their practical applications.
